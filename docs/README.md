## Data pre-processing

### National Children's Study (NCS) Dataset

The raw placenta images we began with are pairs of photos and manually traced arteries and veins for each placenta.

The first step is to adjust the background, crop, and convert the trace to black and white, using the script [`data.setup.initial.py`](https://github.com/canghel/placenta/blob/master/scripts/data.setup.initial.py ).

## Software Specifications

For preprocessing, we used the following:

*	Python 3.6.1 (v3.6.1:69c0db5, Mar 21 2017, 18:41:36) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
*   MATLAB (version, etc.)

## Authors

The imaging portion of the project was led by Jen-Mei Chang, Karamatou (Kara) Yacoubou Djima, and Catalina Anghel, with 
Kellie Archer, Amy Cochran, Anca Radulescu, Rebecca Turner, Lan Zhong and with the support of developmental pathologist Dr. Carolyn Salafia.

(Other authors as well, involved in data collection?)
